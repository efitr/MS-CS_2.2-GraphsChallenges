# Challenge 1
## Goals:
# *Implement the Graph ADT with an adjacency list
# *Implement code to read in a graph from a text file to create an instance of the Graph ADT and use it's methods.

# Inputs:
# * The graph_data.txt
# G
# 1,2,3,4
# (1,2,10)
# (1,4,5)
# (2,3,5)
# (2,4,7)

# Process required to achieve both end points:
# Make the Vertex Class
 
# Outputs:
# Vertices: 4
# Edges: 4
# Edge List:
# (1,2,10)
# (1,4,5)
# (2,3,5)
# (2,4,7)
