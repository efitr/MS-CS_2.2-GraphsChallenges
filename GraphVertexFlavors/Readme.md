# Flavors of Graphs and Vertex
## There are four varieties currently achivable and useful during this challenges:
>* Directed Graph **ADT** and Directed Vertex Adjacency List **DS**. <br/>
* Undirected Graph **ADT** and Undirected Vertex Adjacency List **DS** <br/>
* Weighted Directed Graph **ADT** and Directed Weighted Vertex Adjacency List **DS**. <br/>
* Weighted Undirected Graph **ADT** and Undirected Weighted Vertex Adjacency List **DS**. <br/>

#### Each has it's pros and cons, but while knowing how to structure the possibilities I think you can make better the approach towards adding elements.
