## Challenge 5
Using your Graph ADT code, or in a completely separate program (without a graph class). Determine if a given undirected graph is Eulerian (has an Eulerian Cycle). Your code should be well documented, tested and organized. 

**Input:** A file containing a undirected graph.

`python3 challenge_5.py graph_data.txt`

```
G
1,2,3,4,5
(1,2)
(2,3)
(3,4)
(4,5)
(1,5)
```

**Output** TRUE or FALSE

``` 
This graph is Eulerian: TRUE

```
